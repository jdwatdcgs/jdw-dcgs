    <td>I think I learnt well but I need to focus more and get more work done because today I barely got any work done because I was focusing on other people's' work rather than my own. I also didnâ€™t get work done because even though I was stuck on the Fuze Box input I only asked the teacher for help near the end of the lesson. Which made me waste time unnecessarily.</td>

    <td>I need to learn how to keep on focusing on my work, and my work only. I also need to work harder and more time based rather than saving my pride and keeping on working in my pair. Instead I need to ask my teacher or any other pairs that are  close to me and no what they are doing. </td>

    <td>I will work quicker, harder, focus better, focus on time better, do things more time-related, work in a pair and not on my own, swallowing my pride more and asking a teacher or other pairs near me for help instead of spending most of the lesson on that one bit of work.</td>
